# Implementation-of-Hybrid-Modern-Asymmetric-and-Symmetric-Cipher

(ii) Implementation of Hybrid Modern Asymmetric and Symmetric
Cipher
Assume that Person A wants to communicate with Person B in a confidential
manner using AES or Triple DES as the modern symmetric cipher.
Assume also that secret key required for encryption and decryption is generated
by Person A but it has to be communicated to Person B.
You can perform the following steps:
• Design and implement a Secret Key Exchange Protocol using
RSA/any other asymmetric cipher.

Once the secret key is exchanged, encryption and decryption can be done using
that key by persons A and B respectively.
• Design and implement AES or Triple DES as the modern
symmetric cipher for this purpose.

For AES/Triple DES implementation, demonstrate the encryption and
decryption processes using any ONE mode of operation (use any one of the
approved modes of operation by NIST).
Show normal encryption and decryption operations,
