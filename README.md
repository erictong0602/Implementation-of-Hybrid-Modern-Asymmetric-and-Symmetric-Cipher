# Hill-Cipher-and-Single-Block-Columnar-Transposition-Cipher
(i) Implementation of Product Classical Symmetric Ciphers
Implement any one of the combinations (Substitution and Transposition) of
classical symmetric ciphers, not limited to the following examples.
Examples:
• Affine Cipher and Double Block/Columnar Transposition Cipher
• Playfair Cipher and Rail Fence Cipher (any depth)
• Hill Cipher and Single Block/Columnar Transposition Cipher
Analyse the individual ciphers and product cipher based on encryption and
decryption times taken for different sizes of plaintext and on security aspects.
